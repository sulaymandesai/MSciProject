# Load Data

This folder contains the jupyter notebooks which were used to load flat and mtrx files. The mtrx files were loaded using a Python module called access2thematrix 
(https://pypi.org/project/access2theMatrix/), and the flat files were loaded using a Python script provided in this folder named flatfile_3.py.
